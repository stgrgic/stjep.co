  To design What's Next, we first looked at how people travel to foreign countries for holidays. Then we analysed wait times at the airport. We decomposed passengers journey to determine which moment was the most pertinent for our concept.
</p>
<h3>More than 1.1 billion tourists travelled in 2014.</h3>
<p>
  That's 5% more than the previous year. Each day, around 80.000 flights take off and land accross the world. Those figures are gigantic. But, how do people travel ? How do they plan and organise their holidays in a foreign country ?
</p>
<p>
  Travelling for pleasure implies planning and a bit of preparation (discovery of a city or a country for instance). There is an infinite number of traveller profiles, ranging from the less prepared ( zero planning) to the most <a href="">methodic</a> (pre booked restaurants etc). Most passengers are between these two extremes AndŠ there are also exterior factors which may affect this amount of planning - travelling with children, for example.

<h2>How do people travel ?</h2>
<p>
  Yet, we noticed that throughout passengers in all of the above categories it is frequent that the few hours following their arrival are not planned at all. After they drop their luggage off at the hotel or at their Airbnb appartment, there is often an undefined period before they can start their planned activities. Let's look at an example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>◦ Pierre lands in Berlin at 11am with two friends. They planned to visit the Altes museum in the afternoon.</li>
  <li>◦ They arrive at their hotel at 12.30am. They've planned to visit the museum after eating. Yet, they don't know any cool place to eat and haven't check in any guide book</li>
</ul>

Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when
