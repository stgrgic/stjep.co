<h1>Lab</h1>
<p>The Lab is my learning playground - a collection of code exercises, experiments and projects for the Web. I am always learning, so I will continue to update it as soon as I come up with new ideas.</p>

<ol class="experiment-list">
    {% for experiment in site.experiments reversed %}
        <li class="{{ experiment.status }}">
            <a href="{{ experiment.url }}">{{ experiment.title }}</a>
            {% if experiment.status == "in-progress" %}
                 <span class="status">{{ experiment.status }}</span>
            {% endif %}
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ol>
